  -Nancy is currently working on modifying the algorithm to replay an event
  -Mark is currently working on adding a graphic component for the game

11/02/22 file contains an update of a home screen with basic plays and instructions, when the user hovers over
  the "End Game" button a final screen appears with a game tally for each player and who the overall winner
  of the game is.
  It needs a little refinement for the initial hover button, it occassionally glitches straight to the final
  screen. 
  -Next Steps: continue to work toward adding to the interface screens for tutorial, rules etc

  -Update rules page is updated
  -added images to the interface for human and computer game play, this replaces the orginal text in the game
