# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is for the UNO P5 Group for 4285
This is a game of Rock Paper Scissor using hand recognition software, and a devices integrated camera

Code:
Resource: Countdown code in the main function was acquired by
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-countdown-timer-to-capture-image-using-python-opencv/

Resource: initial Hand recognition program
https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html

10/13/22 file contains the hand recognition program, with a 3-2-1 countdown to a single play event, next steps include:
  -Nancy is currently working on modifying the algorithm to replay an event
  -Mark is currently working on adding a graphic component for the game

11/02/22 file contains an update of a home screen with basic plays and instructions, when the user hovers over
  the "End Game" button a final screen appears with a game tally for each player and who the overall winner
  of the game is.
  It needs a little refinement for the initial hover button, it occassionally glitches straight to the final
  screen. 
  -Next Steps: continue to work toward adding to the interface screens for tutorial, rules etc

11/03/22 new file addition with an upgrade of the overall interface, Mark improved the hovering issues from the previous iteration
  moved buttons around and it is modeled similar to the lo-fi prototype
  Need to add the rules page and tweak
  
11/21/22 uploaded updated files labeled HCI-11-10 
  -Update rules page is updated, modified the text for readability, the screen color was changed to match the overall theme
  -added images to the Play interface for human and computer game play, this replaces the orginal text in the game, the images flicker with a new color as the user decides which move they want to make

12/1/22 -Update since Milestone 3 uploaded final project labeled HCI-P5_Final_Rock_Paper_Scissor
  -Updated the final score page when the user clicks exit, it includes the final score and declares an overall winner. We added the same color scheme to the screen to match the color scheme of the rules page and improved the font for readability
  -Updated and cleaned up the documentation for clarity of each section
  -the only unresolved issue was to terminate the program overall at exit. we believe it was the choice of API and the functionality with the camera API that is making this task incomplete at this point in the semester.
